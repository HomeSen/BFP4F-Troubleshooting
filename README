A small utility to check for the most common sources of errors in Battlefield Play4Free.


The tool checks the following (so far):

1. Prerequisites (libraries that are needed by the game's engine):
   - Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
   - Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
   - Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime 2005 SP1
   - Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime 2008 SP1
   - Microsoft DirectX Runtime 9.0c

2. Hardware Requirements:
   - DirectX 9.0c compliant video card with PixelShader 2.0 support (in hardware)
   - video memory of at least 256MB
   - at least 512MB of RAM (1GB for Vista/Win7)
   - CPU with at least 1.7GHz

3. Network problems:
   - problematic entries inside the local hosts file
   - connections to all needed sockets (IP/FQDN + port)


Additionally it provides some "convenience shortcuts":

1. Links to the prerequisites' download pages
2. Links to the according driver pages
3. A link to the screenshots folder
4. A "quick clear shader cache" shortcut
